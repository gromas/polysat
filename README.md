Polynomial 3-SAT solver


No more questions about P=NP.

This is the stopping point.

It is a polynomial 3-SAT solver that uses O(n³) bytes of disk space to compute SAT / UNSAT in O (n¹⁰) time.

ATTENTION: Some UNSATisfable formulas with unsatisfable logical deadlocked loops this solver wrong marks as SATisfable. I works for this problem. Thank you for your patience.
