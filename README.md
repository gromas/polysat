Polynomial ALL-3-SAT solver


No more questions about P=NP.

This is the stopping point.

It is a polynomial 3-SAT solver that uses O(n³) bytes of disk space to compute SAT / UNSAT in O (n¹⁰) time.

Welcome to the new POLYNOMIAL World!

I'm currently writing an article about the solution and I'm going to upload the sources as soon as possible.
