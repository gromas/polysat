# polysat
**The fully polynomial 3-SAT solver**
*based on a consensus algorithm with the removal of unwanted candidates*

No more questions about P=NP.

Now any 3-SAT problem can be solved with O(2n⁴) bytes of disk space and O(n¹⁰) of time.

Aditional: After solver take answer "SAT" we can get any posible solution without use additional space and for polinomial time. (At this time is not released feature)
